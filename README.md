## 7 disease detections:
*Covid-19 Detection</br>
*Brain Tumour Detection</br>
*Breast Cancer Detection</br>
*Alzheimer Detection</br>
*Diabetes Detection</br>
*Pneumonia Detection</br>
*Heart Disease Detection
</br>
## Demo WebApp
###  Project HealthCure which is an all-in-one medical solution. We know the future is all about AI so here is my idea of bringing 7 disease detections under one platform using the power of AI.

## Project Overview:
#### 
### "Introducing Project HealthCure, a visionary initiative by Mr. Hirthick S, culminating in a remarkable 4-month journey. This all-in-one medical solution harnesses the potential of AI, deep learning, and machine learning to revolutionize healthcare. Witness the outcome of dedicated expertise as we bring together the detection of seven diseases under one powerful platform. Stay tuned for a healthcare transformation driven by innovation and efficiency."

</br>

## Brain Tumour Detection

* Used VGG-16 for feature extraction.
* Used custom-made CNN ahead of CNN.
* The accuracy achieved was around 100% ?(just tested on 10 images).

### FUTURE PLANS ðŸ“ˆ

* As time passes, we will be available with more and more data and we will try to make our models even more accurate by training on much more data.

* Also, we will be adding more disease detections that can be detected using X-ray scans or just by inputting simple numbers.

* We are also planning to add more features like if a person is found positive then our app will show him what precautions he needs to take and how he can cure himself.

* We will also be storing the detection records.

* So these are some future improvements/additions we plan to add.
